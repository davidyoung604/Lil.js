Lil.js: Keeping it simple (and Lil)
===================================

*Lil.js* is a Lil JavaScript library for people who want to KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and keep their imports under 1KB. The syntax is similar to jQuery's (though I have NO affiliation with them) so you can switch over to jQuery if you feel the need with minimal code changes.

Installation
------------
If you don't know how to work with a JS file, go use the Google machine.

Usage
-----
    $("id_of_field_to_select").on("click", function() { var x=1; doStuff(x); });

Notes
-----
- There's very little implemented right now, but I'll expand it over time.
- If you have a request, send me a message here on GitHub.
- Once the fully expanded file reaches a certain size, I'll provide a condensed version too.
